This repository contains a methodology for machine learning on the Titanic dataset, designed for Kaggle competitions. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, and ticket class.

# Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need Python 3 and several libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

# Files
The repository includes the following files :

- train.csv and test.csv : Contain the train and test set of Titanic dataset in CSV format.
- gender_submission.csv : Contains the result for the Kaggle Competitions for the Titanic dataset.
- Methodology for Machine Learning (Titanic Dataset for Kaggle Competitions).ipynb : contains the Jupyter notebooks for the methodology with all the steps you need to understand this dataset.
- README.md: this file, providing an overview of the repository.

# Methodology
The methodology consists of several steps, including data exploration and visualization, data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. Each step is documented in detail in the Jupyter notebooks.

# Usage
Follow the instructions by running the code cells and modifying the code as needed. Make sure to run them in order.

# Results
The methodology achieves an accuracy of 0.81339 on the Titanic dataset, using a Random Forest classifier (for the parameters, read my notebook).

# Credits
This methodology was developed by MetalGray (MetalGearRAY). It is based on the Kaggle competition Titanic : Machine Learning from Disaster.
